In the event of violations of an obligation under the above provisions, the contractor shall be obliged to pay a
contractual penalty of EUR 25,000 for each violation. If the pecuniary advantage given is greater than EUR
25,000, then the contractor shall owe a contractual penalty equal to the amount of the pecuniary advantage.
This is without prejudice to any further claims for damages by GIZ. However, the contractual penalty shall be
deducted from such claims for damages.
If the contractor fails to meet the agreed dates and deadlines for an agreed work and does not deliver the work
within the period of grace set by GIZ, then GIZ shall be entitled, as soon as the period of grace has expired, to
demand a contractual penalty of 0.5% of the remuneration for each week or part thereof after expiration of the
set period of grace; however the contractual penalty shall not exceed a total of 8% of the remuneration.
Supplementary performance
If the contractor's performance is defective, GIZ may require supplementary performance; however, requiring
supplementary performance is not a prerequisite for asserting other rights.
1.22.
Termination
GIZ may terminate the contract at any time, without setting any further deadlines or making a prior request for
deficiencies to be corrected, either wholly or in respect of individual parts of the work and services or with regard
to individual experts.

• CloudEngine 6881 series can be integrated into mainstream SDN and cloud computing platforms flexibly and quickly.
ZTP, Implementing Automatic O&M
• CloudEngine 6881 series support Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). ZTP enables the CloudEngine 6881 series to
automatically obtain and load version files from a USB flash drive or file server, freeing network engineers from onsite
configuration and deployment. ZTP reduces labor costs and improves device deployment efficiency.
• ZTP provides built-in scripts through open APIs. Data center personnel can use a programming language they are familiar
with, such as Python, to centrally configure network devices.
•
ZTP decouples the configuration time of new devices from the device quantity and area distribution, which improves
service provisioning efficiency.

Product Characteristics
High-Density Access
• CloudEngine 6881 series provide up to 48 x 10GE ports, allowing for high-density 10GE server access and smooth
evolution.
• CloudEngine 6881 series provide up to 6 x 100GE QSFP28 ports. Each QSFP28 port can also be used as one 40GE
QSFP+ port, providing flexibility in networking. The uplink 40GE/100GE ports can be connected to CloudEngine 16800 or
CloudEngine 12800 series switches to build a non-blocking network platform.
Inter-device Link Aggregation, High Efficiency and Reliability
•
CloudEngine 6881 series support multi-chassis link aggregation group (M-LAG), which enables links of multiple switches
to aggregate into one to implement device-level link backup.
Switches in an M-LAG system all work in active state to share traffic and back up each other, enhancing system reliability.

Replacement by the contractor
If the contractor requests replacement of an expert designated by name in the contract prior to the start of the
contractually agreed period, GIZ may withdraw from the contract.
Replacement at GIZ's request on good and sufficient grounds
GIZ may demand the replacement of an expert if there are good and sufficient grounds. In particular, the follow-
ing constitute good and sufficient grounds
(a) if it becomes clear that the expert does not meet the requirements in terms of health, language skills, pro-
fessional or personal qualifications or the requirements under 2.1. above;
(b) if the expert's conduct is detrimental to the interests of the Federal Republic of Germany or the ultimate
commissioning party/client, or is the subject of complaint for understandable reasons by the government of
the country of assignment or the partner institution;
(c) if the expert contravenes the duties to be imposed on him/her by the contractor despite having been required
by the government and/or partner institution in the country of assignment to conduct himself/herself in ac-

Networking and Application
Data Center Applications
On a typical data center network, CloudEngine 6881 switches work as TOR switches and connect to CloudEngine16800,
CloudEngine 12800 or CloudEngine 8800 core switches using 40GE/100GE ports, building an end-to-end 100GE full-mesh
network. The core and TOR switches use fabric technologies such as VXLAN to build a non-blocking large Layer 2 network,
which allows for large-scale VM migration and flexible service deployment.

Confidentiality
Any and all data relating to the contract as well as any other information of which the contractor becomes aware
in the course of performing the contract must be treated as confidential during and beyond the term of the
contract. The contractor shall not be permitted to make use of any such data and information for the contractor's
own purposes.

to, reports, accessible to third parties without prior approval in text form by GIZ. Third parties under this provision
also include the ultimate commissioning party/client.

come to an end. A brief description of the contract and scope of activity for the contractor's PR purposes shall
not require GIZ's approval. A statement on the content of the contract and the key results constitutes a brief
description for the purposes of these Terms and Conditions. The contractor must always express in an appro-
priate way that its activities are on behalf of GIZ, and must also name the ultimate commissioning party/client
and any further financing parties.

Obligation of the contractor to report obstacles to the performance of contract
The contractor must notify GIZ in text form without delay of all events and results which delay performance of
the contract or make it impossible, or necessitate modification of the contract, the agreed obligations or the
conditions. This applies in particular to the conducting of a feasibility study on investment measures if the con-
tractor reaches the conclusion that the feasibility study will show that the investment measure would be uneco-
nomical.
Obligation of the contractor to report on the status of the measure
GIZ shall be entitled to review the progress and results of the performance of the contract at any time, including
the project accounts and any special accounts connected to the project. The contractor must keep the necessary
records available and provide the necessary information for this purpose. At the request of GIZ the contractor
shall also provide information to other institutions or persons and organisations commissioned by GIZ as well
as making audits possible, and agreeing to cooperate appropriately in any such audits.
1.14.

earnings foregone wilfully. Fees, salaries and ancillary salary costs are deemed to be saveable if they relate to
periods more than 90 days after receipt of notice of termination. The contractor bears the burden of proof in the
case of exceptions.
1.22.2. Grounds which are the contractor's fault

that cannot be used shall be returned to the contractor at the contractor's expense. If the contract performance

The contractor shall bear all additional costs arising in connection with a replacement on good and sufficient
grounds as well as any additional expenses arising for replacement personnel. If an expert is replaced following
a complaint by the government of the country of assignment or the partner institution, the contractor bears these
costs only if it or its expert is responsible for the cause of complaint. If the contractor or its expert is not respon-
sible for the cause of complaint, 2.3.3. below shall apply analogously. This does not affect the right to termination
for a reason for which the contractor is responsible.
Replacement at GIZ's request for other reasons
GIZ may also demand the replacement of an expert of the contractor for reasons not associated with the expert's
conduct or qualifications. In such cases, GIZ shall reimburse unavoidable expenses in connection with the re-
placement. If these involve salary or ancillary salary expenses for the expert replaced, these are considered
avoidable if they arise more than three months after GIZ's request for replacement, unless the contractor can
prove that the incurring of such costs beyond this period of time was unavoidable and that the expert was not
assigned elsewhere.
Assignment of a new expert after the request for replacement

If the contractually agreed period of employment of the expert is for an uninterrupted period of at least four
expert months, sickness-related absence from work of an expert assigned to the measure of up to 42 days
during any one year or up to 3.5 days a month is deemed to be actual assignment time.

Calculating entitlement to remuneration for vacation and sickness
Payment of per diem and overnight accommodation allowances continues during vacation and sickness-related
absence from work. However, entitlement to the overnight accommodation allowance in calculating vacation
remuneration lapses if the expert takes vacation at the end of the period of assignment abroad in combination
with the final homeward journey. Entitlement to the overnight accommodation allowance then lapses at the time
of the final homeward journey. However, if the contractor can show that overnight accommodation costs have
been incurred for the month of departure due to long-term leases for this very month, the overnight accommo-
dation allowance shall continue to be paid for this month.

the contract. During the term of the contract the contractor shall not accept other orders where a conflict of
interest is to be anticipated due to the nature of the order or due to the contractor's personal or financial con-
nections with a third party unless prior consent has been given by GIZ in text form.
The contractor must not enter into any contracts with natural or legal persons with whom it has personal or
financial ties in connection with contract-related procurements unless GIZ has previously agreed to this in text
form.
In the event that a conflict of interest arises in the course of an existing contractual relationship, the contractor
must disclose this to GIZ without delay and discuss and agree with GIZ any further steps to be taken. If the
parties are unable to reach an agreement in such a case and GIZ terminates the contract, then the contractor is
responsible for the termination. The same shall apply in the event that a conflict of interest is not disclosed
immediately to GIZ, or if the contractor places a contract-related order for procurement with a legal or natural
person with whom it is associated without GIZ having given its prior approval.

sued by the contractual parties with the invalid or unenforceable provision. This shall apply accordingly if it
emerges that the contract has gaps or omissions.
1.26. Written and text form
The contract, any amendments and additions and all material communications must be in written form. In the
event of transmission by telecommunication (e.g. email or telefax), in order to be deemed to be in written form
the copy transmitted must contain the signature of the author or the transmission must take place via GIZ's
procurement platform. Notwithstanding this provision, insofar as text form is provided for in these Terms and
Conditions, it shall consist of a readable declaration on a durable medium in which the person making the dec-
laration is named.
1.27.
Place of jurisdiction
The exclusive places of jurisdiction are Bonn and Frankfurt/Main if the contractor is a merchant or a legal entity
or special fund under public law, or does not have a general place of jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of
Germany. The same shall apply if, after entering into the contract, the contractor relocates its domicile or seat
or habitual residence from the Federal Republic of Germany to a location abroad, or if its domicile or seat or
